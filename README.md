# SI507-Final-project

# 1. Project Overview
# I am going to build a program that lets a user to search for top 100 movies across 17 different genres. 
# This program will provide such information about the movie such as rating and genre etc. Especially, I will use
# Plotly to provide the bar charts when displaying the rating information

# 2. Data Sources
# I used web crawling and scraping techniques to scrape multiple pages from Rotten tomatoes and saved the scraped data
# into the database. 

# 3. Presentation Options and tools
# This program will have an interactivity and provide users options to choose, which will view
# different results. Rating information will be displayed using Plotly bar chart.
